      About me
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for technology and
      software development. During my education at GoIT IT school, I acquired a
      solid understanding of essential technologies and programming languages,
      including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
      <br />
      <br />
      My experience includes working on a variety of projects, including two
      group projects where I served as a Team Lead. This allowed me to develop
      skills in teamwork, project organization, and management.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before embarking on my formal IT education, I actively honed my skills by
      creating websites for myself and friends. This experience allowed me to
      experiment freely and refine my knowledge.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have a strong drive for improvement and creativity, always eager to
      learn new technologies and apply them to different projects. I approach
      each task meticulously and strive to find optimal technical solutions.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am seeking opportunities for further professional growth and to
      collaborate on exciting projects in the software development field.

      <br />
      My interests are marked by diversity and activity, reflecting my love for
      nature and physical engagement.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fishing: Since my early childhood, fishing has evolved from a mere hobby
      to a true passion. Ventures to serene water bodies, the tranquility, and
      the harmony of nature during fishing inspire me. I believe in the
      importance of preserving the natural environment and ethical fishing,
      where each caught specimen is returned to the water. My experiences and
      achievements in this pursuit add color to my life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Cycling: Cycling is another significant passion of mine. I adore the
      feeling of the wind on my face during a swift ride and discovering new
      places and routes on two wheels. Cycling for me is not just physical
      activity but also a way to maintain a healthy lifestyle and high energy
      levels.
      <br />
      <br />
      These two pursuits not only define my personality but also testify to my
      dedication to nature, health, and an active way of life. I am confident
      that these diverse interests will help me apply and develop various skills
      in different aspects of life. <br />
